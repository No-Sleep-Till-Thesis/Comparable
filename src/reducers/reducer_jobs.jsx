As we continue to engineer and test an automated system to manage the service, part of the Associate's task will be to use the company's systems to manually dispatch chariots based on demand and anti-bunching protocols. This task (6-10AM and/or 4-8PM M-F) can be performed remotely (i.e. not in the office) after training in Chariot's SoMa office for two weeks.\n\nThis is an excellent opportunity to join a fast-growing VC-funded startup and execute a critical function and learn new responsibilities in order to move laterally within Operations.",
